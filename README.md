# Developing Data Products Course Project

## Background

This project includes two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I prepared a reproducible pitch presentation about the application using Slidify/Rstudio Presenter.

### Part 1 - The Shiny Application

The associated shiny app uses the "mtcars" dataset available in R to predict a vehicle's horsepower given the number of miles per gallon (MPG), approximate displacement of the car (in cu. in.), and the approximate weight of the car (in 1,000 lbs), stratified by the number of cylinders (4, 6, or 8). 

The user can modify each of the following factors by adjusting the associated slider:

    - Miles per gallon (min: 10, max: 35)
    - Displacement (min: 70, max: 500, in cu. in.)
    - Weight (min: 1, max: 6, in 1,000 lbs)
    
The user can select to view each model specific to the number of cylinders on the vehicle (4, 6, or 8) be checking/unchecking each box below the sliders (e.g. "Show/Hid Model for 4-Cylinder Vehicles").    
   
### Part 2 - The Pitch

The pitch was limited to five slides (including the title slide). The course also required that the pitch be housed on a web page using Slidify or R Studio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.
